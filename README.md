# MLOps Project: Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms. Initially developed as a machine learning project in a machine learning class, the project is now being transformed into a full MLOps pipeline. The goal is to automate the machine learning lifecycle, from data processing and model training to deployment and monitoring, using industry-standard MLOps tools such as **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and others.

### Key Technologies:
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree, Random Forest (to be added)
- **MLOps Tools**: Jenkins, Docker
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub/GitLab
- **Containerization**: Docker for environment setup
- **Model Serialization**: Joblib for saving models
- **Code Quality**: Flake8, Black, Bandit
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest
